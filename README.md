# Financial-Computing-HW

## Description
This is a repository to record the homework assign in *Principle of Financial Computing*.
Using different pricing model to determine the price of different kinds of options. The futher discription for this assignment is in the official website(https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~lyuu/finance1.html). For more information, please refer to it.

Every pricing models is written in class for easy usage and modification. I will make it a more complete project in the near future.

#### Homework1
Write a program to calculate the put price of the European digital option (also called a binary option) and its hedge ratio (i.e., delta) under the CRR binomial model (p. 301 of the slides). The payoff function is $1 if the option is in the money at expiration. Use combinatorics to make your program run in linear time.

#### Homework2
Write a program to calculate the put price an delta of the American-type arithmetic Asian option with a binary payoff. The payoff function is $1 if the put is in the money at expiration. You may use the Hull-White algorithm to implement the tree.

#### Homework3
Write a trinomial tree program to calculate the put prices of single-barrier knock-in options.
